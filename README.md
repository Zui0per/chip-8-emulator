# Rusty-8: A Chip-8 Emulator in Rust and WebAssembly

To be correct Chip-8 is an interpreter and not an emulator. The goal of Chip-8 was to provide a universal language, similair to the Java JVM or the .NET CLR, to develop games. As far as I know,
no Chip-8 processor has actually been built. For more information see the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

I came across Chip-8 when reading "Rust in Action Systems programming concepts and techniques". The book touches a bit on Chip-8 in the context of CPU emulaton. I therfore just went with the name Chip-8 Emulator. 

As a guide for the implementation I used [Cowgod's technical reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)

## How to Play

The original Chip-8 systems used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad. This emulator maps those keys to a modern keyboard as follows:

| Original Keypad | Your Keyboard |
| :-------------: | :-----------: |
| `1 2 3 C`       | `1 2 3 4`     |
| `4 5 6 D`       | `Q W E R`     |
| `7 8 9 E`       | `A S D F`     |
| `A 0 B F`       | `Z X C V`     |

Use the on-screen controls to select and load different ROMs.

## Local Development and Building from Source

Want to run the project locally? Hereâ€™s how. 
Hint: This process was not tested. 

### Prerequisites

*   **Rust:** Install from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
*   **`wasm-pack`:** The tool for building Rust-generated WebAssembly.
    ```bash
    cargo install wasm-pack
    ```
*   **Node.js and npm:** For running the frontend development server. Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Build

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zui0per/chip-8-emulator.git 
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd web 
    npm ci
    ```
2.  **Build the WebAssembly module:**
    This command compiles the Rust code into Wasm and generates the necessary JavaScript bindings, placing them in the `web/wasm` directory.
    ```bash
    npm run build-wasm
    ```
3.  **Run the frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    The console will show at which port the application will be available.

### Running Tests

To run the full suite of unit tests for the Chip-8 core logic:
```bash
npm run test
# or via cargo
cd ..
cargo test 
```
